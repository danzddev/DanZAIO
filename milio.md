### W - Cozy Campfire

Milio's signature shielding and healing ability. DanZ-AIO prioritizes ally safety and strategic W usage:

*   **Auto W Lethal Damage:** [Toggle - ON by default]
    *   Automatically casts W on allies (or self) to prevent lethal incoming damage from enemy spells. This feature has the highest priority to ensure survival.

*   **Auto W Ally Spell Shield:** [Toggle - ON by default]
    *   Automatically uses W on allies who are about to be hit by high-danger enemy skillshots, providing a shield to mitigate damage.

*   **Use W on Fleeing Ally:** [Toggle - ON by default]
    *   If an ally is fleeing and low health, W will be cast on them to aid their escape.

*   **W Max Allies Possible:** [Toggle - ON by default]
    *   Attempts to position the W cast to maximize the number of allies shielded by "Cozy Campfire."

*   **Prioritize Dying Ally (Even if less allies hit):** [Toggle - ON by default]
    *   If enabled, will prioritize casting W on a very low health ally, even if it means shielding fewer allies overall.  Survival of a critical ally takes precedence.

*   **Ally Shield HP Limit % (Combo):** [Slider - 70%, Range 0-100%]
    *   Sets the maximum HP percentage of an ally for W to be cast on them during combo scenarios. This prevents over-shielding allies who are already healthy.

*   **Ally Shield HP Limit % (Harass):** [Slider - 50%, Range 0-100%]
    *   Sets the maximum HP percentage of an ally for W to be cast on them during harass scenarios.  Generally lower than combo to conserve mana in lane.

*   **Range:** [Slider - 950, Max Range 950]
    *   Sets the maximum casting range for W.  Generally, you'll want to keep this at the maximum range.

*   **Semi-Cast Key W:** [Keybind - H by default]
    *   Hold this key to manually cast W at your cursor position.  Useful for preemptive shielding or specific placements.

*   **Ally Flee HP Limit % (W):** [Slider - 30%, Range 0-100%]

*   **W Skillshot Danger Level:** [Dropdown - Medium by default, Options: Low, Medium, High, Extreme]
    *   Controls the minimum danger level of enemy skillshots that will trigger automatic W spell shield.  Higher danger levels mean W will only react to more threatening spells.
    *   *Low:* Reacts to Danger Level 2+ skillshots.
    *   *Medium:* Reacts to Danger Level 3+ skillshots.
    *   *High:* Reacts to Danger Level 4+ skillshots.
    *   *Extreme:* Reacts to Danger Level 5 skillshots only (most dangerous).

*   **Semi-Cast Key E:** [Keybind - J by default]
    *   Hold this key to manually cast E. By default, it will prioritize casting on an ally targetted by your Target Selector. If no valid ally target is found, it will self-cast E.

*   **Combo Ally Attack Enemy E:** [Toggle - ON by default]
    *   Automatically casts E on an ally when they are auto-attacking an enemy champion during combo/hybrid mode. This provides a shield and speed boost to help allies secure kills or win trades.

*   **E Priority:** [Dropdown - Ally by default, Options: Self, Ally]
    *   Determines the priority target for E semi-cast and potentially in other automated scenarios (though less relevant for E automation compared to W).
        *   *Self:* Prioritizes self-casting E when the semi-cast key is pressed.
        *   *Ally:* Prioritizes casting E on a selected ally (Target Selector target) when the semi-cast key is pressed. If no valid ally is selected, it may fall back to self-cast or not cast.
